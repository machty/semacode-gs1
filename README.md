# Ruby Semacode Encoder

**NOTE**: This version of the semacode library replaces the first byte in the
barcode you provide with the <FNC1> codeword character AKA ~1, ]d2 or <F1>. It
was the only way I could figure out to insert this character, as the Ruby
wrapper and even the C library do not provide a way I could do this besides
hard coding it at the right spot. I suggest you pass values like this:

    DataMatrix::Encoder.new('x' + my_actual_data)

## Introduction

This Ruby extension implements a DataMatrix encoder for Ruby. It is typically
used to create semacodes, which are barcodes, that contain URLs. This encoder
does not create image files or visual representations of the semacode. This is
because it can be used for more than creating images, such as rendering
semacodes to HTML, SVG, PDF or even stored in a database or file for later
use.

See test.rb for an example of how to create a visual symbol for a semacode, it
presents a semacode in HTML and plain text formats, and this can give you an
idea of how to start.

Once you have a visual representation of the semacode, you can use a reader,
such as those from http://semacode.org on your camera phone, to capture the
URL embedded in the semacode and proceed directly to that web site.

## Quick Start

Configure the extension to your local system and ruby

    ruby extconf.rb

Build the extension

    make

Test that it works

    ruby test.rb

Install the extension (you may need to become root)

    make install

You should take a look at tests/test.rb to understand how to use this. It
includes some code to generate a semacode using HTML and CSS, so that could
end up being useful.


## USAGE

Here's some basic ways in which you can make use of this extension. It tries
to show by example, how the semacodes can be created and what can be done with
or to a semacode object.


Include this library

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'semacode'

Create a semacode

    semacode = Barcode::Semacode.new "http://sohne.net/projects/semafox/"

Return the semacode as an array of arrays of boolean

    The first element of the array is the top row, the last element is the
    bottom row. the array length is the semacode height, and each element is
    an array as wide as the semacode width

    grid = semacode.data or
    grid = semacode.to_a or

Return the encoding list used to create the semacode

    This encoding list is composed of the 'character set', complete with
    shifts from one encoding type to another, that is used for the DataMatrix
    algorithm.

    encoding = semacode.encoding

Return the semacode as a string

    The string is a comma separated list of character vectors. Each vector is a row
    in the semacode symbol, the top row is first, and the bottom row is last. Inside
    each row, the vector reads from left to right.

    semacode.to_s or
    semacode.to_str

Encode another string

    semacode.encode "http://sohne.net"

Get the width of the semacode

    semacode.width

Get the height of the semacode

    semacode.height

How long is the semacode? (width * height)

    semacode.length or
    semacode.size

Get the raw encoded length (before padding and before ECC)

    semacode.raw_encoded_length

Get the symbol size

    The max number of characters this semacode type
    (specific width x height) can hold is called the
    symbol size.

    semacode.symbol_size

Count the ECC bytes

    How many bytes were used for error correction?

    semacode.ecc_bytes


## NOTES

The C code can throw runtime exceptions. Be sure to include
a catch block if you want to use this in production. Mostly
the exceptions are not recoverable, except for when the data
is too long, in which case you can shorten it and try again.

There are two type of exceptions that it will throw. The first
is a RangeError exception, which happens when the input is too
long or when it just can't find a fit for the data. The second
is a ArgumentError (ArgError?) exception that gets thrown when
the input contains data it cannot handle.
